// This file configures the initialization of Sentry for edge features (middleware, edge routes, and so on).
// The config you add here will be used whenever one of the edge features is loaded.
// Note that this config is unrelated to the Vercel Edge Runtime and is also required when running locally.

  // Never hardcode DSNs. Configure via environment only.
