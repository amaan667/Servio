# ADR 0049: Quality Assurance Strategy

## Status
Accepted

## Context
The Servio platform needs a comprehensive quality assurance strategy to ensure product quality and reliability. Requirements include:
- Quality standards
- Testing processes
- Code reviews
- Performance monitoring
- User feedback

## Decision
We will implement a comprehensive quality assurance strategy with automated testing and continuous monitoring. This provides:
- Quality standards
- Automated testing
- Code reviews
- Performance monitoring
- User feedback

### Implementation Details

1. **Quality Standards**
   - Coding standards
   - Design guidelines
   - Performance benchmarks
   - Security requirements
   - Accessibility standards

2. **Testing Processes**
   - Unit tests
   - Integration tests
   - E2E tests
   - Performance tests
   - Security tests

3. **Code Reviews**
   - Mandatory reviews
   - Review checklist
   - Automated checks
   - Reviewer assignment
   - Approval process

4. **Performance Monitoring**
   - Core Web Vitals
   - API performance
   - Database performance
   - Error rates
   - User satisfaction

5. **User Feedback**
   - In-app feedback
   - Beta testing
   - User interviews
   - Analytics analysis
   - Continuous improvement

## Consequences
- Positive:
  - Quality standards
  - Automated testing
  - Code reviews
  - Performance monitoring
  - User feedback
- Negative:
  - Testing overhead
  - Review time
  - Process complexity
  - Resource allocation

## Alternatives Considered
- **Minimal QA**: Poor quality, bugs in production
- **Manual only**: Slow, error-prone
- **No code reviews**: Poor quality, knowledge gaps
- **Reactive only**: Late detection, poor experience
