# ADR 0035: Roadmap and Prioritization Strategy

## Status
Accepted

## Context
The Servio platform needs a clear roadmap and prioritization strategy to guide development. Requirements include:
- Clear product vision
- Feature prioritization
- Stakeholder alignment
- Resource allocation
- Communication

## Decision
We will implement a comprehensive roadmap and prioritization strategy using RICE scoring and stakeholder input. This provides:
- Clear product vision
- Data-driven prioritization
- Stakeholder alignment
- Efficient resource allocation
- Transparent communication

### Implementation Details

1. **Prioritization Framework**
   - RICE scoring (Reach, Impact, Confidence, Effort)
   - MoSCoW method (Must, Should, Could, Won't)
   - Value vs. Effort matrix
   - Stakeholder voting
   - Regular reviews

2. **Roadmap Planning**
   - Short-term (1-3 months)
   - Medium-term (3-6 months)
   - Long-term (6-12 months)
   - Strategic initiatives
   - Technical debt

3. **Stakeholder Management**
   - Regular stakeholder meetings
   - Feedback collection
   - Requirement gathering
   - Communication updates
   - Expectation management

4. **Resource Allocation**
   - Team capacity planning
   - Skill matching
   - Timeline estimation
   - Risk assessment
   - Contingency planning

5. **Communication**
   - Public roadmap
   - Internal updates
   - Release notes
   - Progress tracking
   - Change notifications

## Consequences
- Positive:
  - Clear direction
  - Data-driven decisions
  - Stakeholder alignment
  - Efficient resource use
  - Transparent communication
- Negative:
  - Planning overhead
  - Rigidity
  - Stakeholder conflicts
  - Changing priorities

## Alternatives Considered
- **No roadmap**: Lack of direction, reactive
- **CEO-driven**: Limited perspective, bias
- **Customer-only**: Missed strategic opportunities
- **Developer-only**: Misaligned with business
