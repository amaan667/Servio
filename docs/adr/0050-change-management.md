## Decision
We will implement a comprehensive change management strategy with structured processes and clear communication. This provides:

- Clear communication
- Rollback procedures
- Documentation

### Implementation Details

1. **Change Process**
   - Change requests
   - Approval workflow
   - Impact assessment
   - Testing requirements
   - Deployment scheduling

2. **Impact Assessment**
   - Risk analysis
   - User impact
   - Performance impact
   - Security impact
   - Dependency analysis

3. **Communication**
   - Stakeholder notification
   - User communication
   - Timeline updates
   - Status reporting
   - Post-change review

4. **Rollback Procedures**
   - Rollback triggers
   - Rollback procedures
   - Rollback testing
   - Rollback communication
   - Post-rollback analysis

5. **Documentation**
   - Change logs
   - Impact documentation
   - Testing results
   - Deployment records
   - Lessons learned

## Consequences
- Positive:
  - Structured change process
  - Impact assessment
  - Clear communication
  - Rollback procedures
  - Documentation
- Negative:
  - Process overhead
  - Approval delays
  - Documentation time
  - Coordination complexity

## Alternatives Considered

- **Ad-hoc only**: Inconsistent, error-prone
- **Minimal process**: Insufficient control, poor communication
- **Over-controlled**: Slow, bureaucratic
