We will implement a comprehensive knowledge management strategy with centralized repositories and easy access. This provides:
- Knowledge capture
- Organization
- Accessibility
- Sharing and collaboration
- Continuous improvement

### Implementation Details

1. **Knowledge Capture**
   - Documentation standards
   - Code comments
   - Architecture decisions (ADRs)
   - Meeting notes
   - Lessons learned

2. **Organization**
   - Centralized repository
   - Tagging and categorization
   - Search functionality
   - Version control
   - Regular reviews

3. **Accessibility**
   - Easy access
   - Search capabilities
   - Multiple formats
   - Mobile access
   - Offline access

4. **Sharing and Collaboration**
   - Knowledge sharing
   - Peer reviews
   - Cross-team collaboration
   - External sharing (where appropriate)
   - Community contributions

5. **Continuous Improvement**
   - Regular updates
   - Feedback loops
   - Usage analytics
   - Content optimization
   - Knowledge gaps identification

## Consequences
- Positive:
  - Knowledge capture
  - Organization
  - Accessibility
  - Sharing and collaboration
  - Continuous improvement
- Negative:
  - Maintenance overhead
  - Adoption challenges
  - Content quality
  - Time investment

## Alternatives Considered
- **No knowledge management**: Lost knowledge, repeated mistakes
- **Decentralized only**: Hard to find, inconsistent
- **Documentation only**: Limited capture, poor organization
- **Over-structured**: Too complex, low adoption
