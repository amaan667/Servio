## Decision
We will implement a comprehensive lessons learned and continuous improvement strategy with systematic reviews and cultural emphasis. This provides:
- Incident reviews
- Post-mortems
- Knowledge capture
- Process improvement
- Cultural mindset

### Implementation Details

1. **Incident Reviews**
   - Incident classification
   - Impact assessment
   - Root cause analysis
   - Action items
   - Follow-up tracking

2. **Post-mortems**
   - Blameless culture
   - Timeline reconstruction
   - Root cause analysis
   - Prevention strategies
   - Documentation

3. **Knowledge Capture**
   - Lessons learned database
   - Best practices documentation
   - Anti-patterns catalog
   - Decision records (ADRs)
   - Regular reviews

4. **Process Improvement**
   - Process audits
   - Bottleneck identification
   - Automation opportunities
   - Tool evaluation
   - Workflow optimization

5. **Cultural Mindset**
   - Blameless culture
   - Psychological safety
   - Learning orientation
   - Experimentation encouragement
   - Continuous improvement focus

## Consequences
- Positive:
  - Incident reviews
  - Post-mortems
  - Knowledge capture
  - Process improvement
  - Cultural mindset
- Negative:
  - Time investment
  - Cultural challenges
  - Documentation overhead
  - Process complexity

## Alternatives Considered
- **No reviews**: Repeated mistakes, no learning
- **Blame culture**: Fear, hiding issues, no learning
- **Ad-hoc only**: Inconsistent, lost knowledge
- **Minimal process**: Limited improvement
