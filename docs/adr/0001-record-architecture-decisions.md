# ADR-0001: Record Architecture Decisions

## Status

Accepted

## Context

We need to record the architectural decisions made on this project. This helps future developers understand why certain decisions were made and provides context for future changes.

## Decision

We will use Architecture Decision Records (ADRs) as described by Michael Nygard in [this article](http://thinkrelevance.com/blog/2011/11/15/documenting-architecture-decisions).

ADRs will be stored in `docs/adr/` and follow the naming convention `NNNN-title.md` where:
- `NNNN` is a sequential number
- `title` is a short descriptive title in kebab-case

Each ADR should include:
- Status (Proposed, Accepted, Rejected, Deprecated, Superseded)
- Context
- Decision
- Consequences

## Consequences

- Architectural decisions are documented
- Future developers can understand the reasoning
- Decisions can be revisited and updated
- Knowledge is preserved

## Examples

See other ADRs in this directory for examples of how to document decisions.
